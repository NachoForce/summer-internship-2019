## C# Hello World

I attempted to program Hello World in C# using dotnet, and found two ways to do it:
either using iTerm2 to use dotnet, or in Visual Studio Code's terminal. Both ways, once I created my App, had Hello World
preloaded as a default program, so from then, I simply had to dotnet run, and I had successfully printed Hello World in both the iTerm2 console andthe console inside Visual Studio Code
